# MATH-545-Chapter-7
This repository relates to Chapter 5 of the textbook "A Friendly Introduction to Numerical Linear Algebra", and contains algorithms used for Curve Fitting, or Interpolation.  MATH 545 - Methods of Computational Modeling - This survey course provides the computational foundations of Simulation, Optimization and Analysis (SOMA). To this end the course introduces the computational toolset necessary to investigate numerical solutions to differential equations and linear systems and method of optimization, including iterative methods, with analysis of stability and error.
